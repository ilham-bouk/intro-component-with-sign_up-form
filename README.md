## Overview

### The challenge

Practice building out a sign-up form complete with client-side validation using JavaScript. The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. 2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Submit their email address using an input field.
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty & the email address is not formatted correctly.

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## My process

### Built with
 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.<br>
There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
