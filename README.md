## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS. The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create the background shape using code

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## My process

### Built with
 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.<br>
There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
